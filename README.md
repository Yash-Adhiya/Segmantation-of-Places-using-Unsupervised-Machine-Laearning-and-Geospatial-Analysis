# Segmantation-of-Places-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Laearning-and-Geospatial-Analysis

This Project was the part of the Infinite Analytics pvt limited where I have given geospatial co-ordinates (Latitude/longtitude). 
Each Point contains different charcteristics of the Location(mainly withing Banglore and Mumbai). We call this data a point of intrest data. 
Every geographic location corespond to a special aminites of that place which defines the charecteristics of that place and that can be identified by the machine learning concept "clustering". 
The clustering took place based on the latitude and longitude, and total of six cluster has formed for both city. 
In regards to this project, main aim is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis of the places and segment them based on Geographical similarities. 

This project still can be enhanced with data enrichment and better insights can be derived.
